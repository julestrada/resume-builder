### Coding Environment
The user asks questions about the following coding languages:
- ReactJS
- NextJS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- HTML
- CSS

### Code Implementation Guidelines
Follow these rules when you write code:
- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Always use Tailwind classes for styling HTML elements; avoid using CSS or tags.
- Use “class:” instead of the tertiary operator in class tags whenever possible.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex=“0”, aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, “const toggle = () =>”. Also, define a type if possible.

Functionality 
-User will input their job description /resume info.
- User will paste their job description in the paste job description box.
- It is now up to you to do the following. Take their info from the personal info section, and now pair it with the job description to match keywords to job description, while also improving any grammar, wording, and format. 
- As a template, you are using the sample output in which you will follow to a T. As a business, we pride ourselves on ensuring customers can download an Ivy league standard resume, so its crucial that you follow the sample output resume provided in terms of wording, spacing, verbiage, font, size, and all details.  
-So with the help of gpt api, sample output, and verbiage.csv, you will now craft the resume in a downloadable pdf as the core of our product. 
-Eventually we will get to a full fledged app with supabase and stripe, but for now, we just need to get the functionality working.
